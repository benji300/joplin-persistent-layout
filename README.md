## Usage

### Persist layout for a note

To persist the layout for a note simply add one of the following tags as specified:

| Tag             | Layout                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| `layout:editor` | Markdown editor view   |
| `layout:split`  | Split view             |
| `layout:viewer` | Rendered markdown view |

This can be done by manually adding them to the notes or via the [command](#commands).

- **The setting `View > Layout button sequence` must be set according to the labels used.**
  That means, if the label `layout:viewer` is set in at least one note, the setting must also contain `Viewer`.
  Otherwise layout will not be changed to the expected one.
- When the selected note is changed, the editor layout is changed also.
- If none of the tags is specified, the editor layout is not changed. The currently set one will be kept, as before.
- If more than one is specified, they are checked in the order above and the first matching one is used.

## Commands

This plugin provides additional commands as described in the following table.

| Command Label         | Command ID            | Description                                                       | Menu contexts                                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Persist editor layout | `persistEditorLayout` | Persist the current active editor layout for the selected note(s) | `Tools`, `NoteListContext`, `Command palette` |

### Keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts can be assigned in user options via `Tools > Options > Keyboard Shortcuts` to all [commands](#commands) which are assigned to the `Tools` menu context.
